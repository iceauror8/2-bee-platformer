Pitch:
You play as a bee in a 2D platformer game where you can fly using a flight meter (think Pharah from Overwatch). Puzzle-based gameplay with obstacles rather than combat, though you do have a stinger.

Gameplay:


1 sting per level + time limit to beat the level after you use it (you have to turn around to sting)


Boss that’s a person that uses a lot of verticality, your screen can only see a person’s foot unless you fly up

When you pick up items, your flight meter depletes more quickly
Bouncey pad that can be a leaf in the forest level, honey-jello in the hive level

Programming:
Flight Meter - Floating point number that depletes as a key is pressed down.
